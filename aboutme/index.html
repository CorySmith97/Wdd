        <h2>Cory Smith</h2>
        <p>My name is Cory Smith. I am from Mesa Arizona and am currently studying Computer Science. I very much enjoy spending time doing things with my friends, as well as read. I love reading anything fantasy based. I have spent the past few months working in roofing back in arizona and it was a great experience. <p>

        </p>I served a mission in Saltillo Mexico. My favorite thing about BYU-I is the weather and the overall loving enviornment. Learning web design is a skill that will bless me in any field that I go into as it is something that I can use to help get started in what I persue. Ive been a member of the Church my entire life. My favorite scripture is something that changes on a fairly regular basis. As of right now it is probably 2nd Nephi 4:30-31. </p>
