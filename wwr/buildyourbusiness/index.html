                <h2> No business owner wants to spend all of their time working paperwork and making sure their calender is lined up.
                    BuildYourBusiness is a web application with the purpose of helping small businesses streamline
                    their day to day. The application offers many features to allow your to focus on doing the best job you can.
                    We offer the a combination application that manages your calendar for each member of your team, as well as 
                    invoice and money management for your day to day operations.  
                </h2>
                <h3>Calendars are often times the main organizational tool that business owners use on a daily basis. We have
                        taken notice of that and seek to streamline the calendar system that you use. Like many other competetors we
                        offer the ability to manage multiple calendars so that each member of your team can see their daily tasks, and plan accordingly.
                        In our experience as teams begin to utilize these tools, their businesses begin to grow, and the owner roll slowly is able to take
                        a less stressed role. While it may seem simple, when the proper tools are available, works of art are able to be created.
