                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We aim to target small businesses in many manual labor fields such as roofing, plumbing, or other service based comapnies. 
                            BuildYourBusiness provides the tools necessary to grow your business without growing your stress levels.
                            The idea for BYB came while I was working for a supervisor at a small roofing company. I couldn't help but notice the communication
                            difficulties we had with the team. We had a calender that supervisors had access to, but not the crew members could see.
                            I saw that if we could make a better system for each person in the company to understand their role, there would be much less
                            confusion and everyone would be happier.
                        </p>

                            As a higher up I also saw the pain that managing invoices could be. It would be so nice if the invoices could easily be integrated
                            into the calender so as I manager I could have access to all the important information related to the client. BYB was built in part
                            with this in mind. Ease of sending and managing invoices to take the stress off you, the owner.
