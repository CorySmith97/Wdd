                    No one wants to spend a lot of money for services that can be found for free in many places.
                    We understand that. Our goal was to be approachable for the business that is just starting out, and have a decent pricing for 
                    scalability. That is where our entire pricing mentality comes from. Making it easy for you.
                </p>

                    To start a new account it comes in at $20 a month for the first user. Each additional user afterwards comes in at an additional 
                    $5 a month until you reach 10 members. For each user after the first 10 the price is $3 a month. These prices all increase and 
                    all come from the same business account.
