    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The goal of this website is to bring people to our e-commerce site. If the website is easy to use
        and looks good we will have a much easier time breaking into the market. 
        E-commerce is the majority of where products are sold now, so we need to optimize how we
        interact with this branch of the market. This website is also meant
        to help to bring those who usually dont spend much time outdoor out to experience nature with the rest of us.
        The site needs to show the best of times so as to bring others to want to try white water rafting 
        which is the main purpose of the site. Effective ways to bring excitement to an activity
        that is common in marketing strategies is to show pictures of people while they are participating 
        and enjoying the activity.
        White water rafting is a scary activity for many, but we can bridge that gap by giving them a 
        system of guides to help them. The website is supposed to help bring that confidence with Dry Oar. 
        The website should also show where these adventures will take place, so as to allow people to better
        plan what their trips should be. We will also provide ways to easily pay for the experience.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The person who would visit this website is the adventuous type.
        The type of person who find that they are happiest when they 
        find themselves our in nature. In addition to the nortaml adventurous type, with one of our goals
        being to bring new people out into nature, our audience will additionally be extended to those who 
        are on the fence about going on an adventure outdoors. We seek to find those who have never gone white water rafting, and 
        find apprehentions about it, but are curious none the less. We can help change their view on what is considered okay and safe for them
        to experience in their lives. Many people want to find adventure, but just dont know where to find it, or are either too afraid to 
        do it by themselves. We seek to bridge that gap, so we look for those people. The website will also be used as a recruitment took to 
        find more people who will be capable guides. With an active good looking site we hope to build repport and grow our staff. We also
        are looking for experienced guides as well. Those who are already familiar with white water rafting so we can have a good healthy
        mix a newer young guides, as well as experinced ones.
